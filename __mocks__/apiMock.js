It pits the respective Asian and African champions against each other, each of whom lost their opening matches 0-2. At which point, you might argue, the similarities end. While Senegal looked sprightly and competitive against the Netherlands, particularly early on, and were undone mainly by a lack of cutting edge up front, Qatar turned in a rabbits-trapped-in-headlights non-performance against Ecuador, and were lucky their opponents declared at half-time. All that Aspire academy cash, all those gifted places in other tournaments, including this one as hosts, all that unsavoury geopolitical positioning – and for <em>that</em>?</p> \n  <p>“Emotionally, things were very difficult, and dealing with the World Cup is completely different. I hope that the performance will be as competitive against Senegal,” admitted their manager, Felix Sánchez, yesterday, adding: “We prepared ourselves for the possibility of an early exit, but this does not mean the end of the project. I am confident that Qatar will continue their project to maintain a strong team, compete and qualify for the upcoming tournaments.” Ah yes, Projects. Always with the Projects.</p> \n  <p>Anyway, Qatar almost certainly won’t play as poorly again, and they have shown some pedigree in recent times. Senegal, you fancy, have more though but they sorely missed Sadio Mané against the Dutch. They will also be sweating on the full match-fitness of Cheikhou Kouyaté and Abdou Diallo, important cogs in the team who were forced off in Monday’s match with niggles. In as much as we can generalise, there does seem to be an early pattern of African teams struggling to score despite plenty of quality and attacking intent. Will that pattern shift here?</p> \n  <p>Kick off 1pm GMT.</p> \n </div> \n</div>',

            "Netherlands v Ecuador will be under way shortly, with Qatar’s hopes of remaining in the competition dependent on an unlikely Ecuador victory. Barry Glendenning is describing it. News from elsewhere: the BBC is reporting that Neymar is out of Brazil’s next two matches with ligament damage in his right ankle. My kind of email correspondence: “Hi Tom, Hope you enjoyed your apple cake, I made an apple tart at halftime. Disappointed for Wales too.” That’s pretty smart work, given all the first-half injury time cutting into baking time. But the cake was lush, thanks That was a pretty serviceable second half. Senegal were clearly superior, and had enough finishing power, and ability off the bench, to see the job through. And Qatar actually raised their game, creating a decent flurry of chances and scoring a well-crafted goal. Afif and Mohamad in particular had good games, while Sabaly, Diedhiou and Diatta were among the Senegal players to impress. Senegal record Africa’s first win at these finals, Qatar are heading out unless Ecuador beat the Netherlands 90+5 mins: Dieng wins Senegal a corner, and Gueye fiddles about by the flag and wins another, but doesn’t have time to take it. For that’s it. 90+4 mins: Almoez Ali, who hasn’t lived up to expectations, does well here with a neat turn and run before shooting just over. 90+3 mins: Ndiaye makes an impact again with a probing cross from the right that Barsham has to punch clear under pressure. The stadium has rapidly emptied, though Senegal’s fans are still very much havin’ it. 90 mins: Qatar are getting into wide positions and putting decent crosses in now, as another searching one is met by a blocked header. We’ll have six added minutes, which is modest by the standards of this tournament. 87 mins: Pape Ciss receives a yellow card for scything down Mohamad after the Qatar player had snatched a loose ball just inside the Senegal half. And Hassan has a decent go from the free-kick, hammering a fierce left-foot shot just wide of Mendy’s left-hand post. Qatar have started to play when it’s too late. 85 mins: Qatar made two more subs just before the goal – Waad for Ahmed, Salman for Miguel That was simple and well worked – smart interplay on the right leading to a good low cross from Iliman Ndiaye to Dieng inside the box, who turned and clipped it firmly past Barsham That should seal it. 79 mins: Senegal win a corner instantly from the kick-off, it’s low and cleared for another. Which comes to nowt. Just before the goal Senegal made two more subs – Mendy and Jakobs off, Pape Sarr and Pape Cissé on. This was a fine goal, Qatar’s first ever at the finals – a raking ball found Mohamad on the right and his accurate cross was headed down and firmly to the right of Mendy and into the corner. Hang on a sec; game on? 76 mins: “Shades of Gordon Banks vs Pele in that last Mendy save?” hyperventilates William Hargreaves. Let’s return to this MBM in 52 years and see eh? 74 mins: Qatar win another corner after another effective cross, but it’s headed out for a home throw. Two more Senegal subs Bamba Dieng and Sheffield United’s Iliman N’Diaye for Sarr and Diedhiou. One Championship player for another. Qatar make a change too – the wideman Muntari for al-Hydos, who hands the armband to Hassan. 70 mins: A newly energised Mohamad cuts inside on the right, tries to play a give and go with al-Haydos on the edge of the area but he misreads it totally and Mohamad has to hare after his own pass, which he doesn’t quite reach. 69 mins: The busy Sabaly slides a ball into Mendy on the right-hand edge of the area but his angled shot is a tad too high and wide. 67 mins: Big chance for Qatar. A fine probing cross from the left finds Mohamad six yards out, whose effort is turned behind for a corner. You wait all tournament for a shot on target then two come at once. This is Qatar’s best spell of the tournament “Full-throated support for Catarr. Despite coughing up 2 goals Catarrh seem to be quite phlegmatic,” honks Ben Bamford in the “my wife’s gone to the West Indies” style. 64 mins: Senegal substitution: Ciss for Diatta 64 mins: One corner becomes two, and from the second, Miguel turns deftly just inside the area but then skews his shot horribly high and wide. But it’s a free-kick to Senegal anyway. 63 mins: They have had a shot on target! Afif and Ali combine smartly on the edge of the area, and the latter’s firm low drive is brilliantly turned behind by Mendy 61 mins: Chance for Qatar! Hassan looks up and has a crack from wide on the left, 25 yards out, and it’s two or three inches wide. That shot on target may yet come. 59 mins: A half-chance for Senegal as Koulibaly’s low cross from the right finds Diedhiou who turns and shoots but the effort is blocked. 57 mins: Afif leads another Qatar break and he has Ahmed in a good position to his right but he can’t pick him out. A waste. 54 mins: Afif plays in al-Haydos down the right who draws a foul from Diedhiou (I think). The free-kick causes some bother in a packed area (Senegal had all 11 back) and another half-chance shot from Hassan is blocked. 52 mins: Booking for Senegal’s Jakob for a stray and dangerous elbow out on the left. 51 mins: Qatar nearly have their first effort on target when Hassan meets a raking free-kick from the left with a glancing header but he can’t get enough on it and it drifts wide. And it’s a free-kick against them for a foul anyway. Classic goal from a corner, that. It’s skimmed in and Diedhiou advances to the near post, escapes his marker and angles a fine header into the opposite top corner. Qatar are heading for the exit. And they score from the corner! 47 mins: There’s very definitely not a full house for this, and it’s Senegal’s fans making more noise at the minute. Senegal win the first corner of the half when Sarr skips clear down the right but Hassan puts in a fine, clean tackle to thwart him Peep! Senegal restart proceedings … no changes made by either side. The players are back out … The Beeb have helpfully reminded us that it’s FA Cup second round weekend, and Kings Lynn v League Two surprise package Stevenage looks a good’un. Anyone going to a domestic game anywhere in the world tomorrow? Half-time reading: a nice piece on Australia’s Garang Kuol Some email action. Richard Hirst writes: “Although as an England supporter I wouldn’t want it to happen, I think you are wrong about a USA win against England ending Wales’ chances. Arguably the most uncomplicated, albeit unlikely, way for Wales to progress is for the USA to beat England and Iran and Wales to beat England. That way USA finish with seven points, Wales four and England and Iran three. Simples!” True, but if USA win tonight, England will have to field their strongest side against Wales; if England win, they won’t. Southgate oversaw a dead-rubber flop against Belgium four years ago – more of the same would suit Wales. “The Non-European teams are doing fine in this World cup,” says Bogdan Katarlic. “they have a lot of players playing in the European clubs and also it seems to me that their FAs are more serious than they were before. What do you think why they have improved in the last few years?” I think the European club game’s a factor, both in terms of it containing, and schooling, more non-European players, but also a slight sense that for European players, club trumps country whereas the international game’s a bigger deal elsewhere. But these are just random pub thoughts really. Senegal play out the remainder of the half with possession football, and that brings to an end a dominant first half from the African champions. It’s not been a thriller and Qatar are on the verge of the quickest host-exit from a World Cup. But they’re only a goal down and have had the odd flurry. Right, I’m off for a bit of apple cake and a sulk about Wales. Ben Fisher has described that more here. back in a bit. 45+6 mins: A half-chance as the ball is clipped forward for local hero Ali on the right of the area but Mendy comes out to claim. 45+5 mins: Afif, Qatar’s best player so far, wins a corner on the left but it’s headed clear and Diallo smartly wins Senegal a throw on the left. 45+3 mins: Diallo begins another attack with some elegant dribbling in his own half before it’s worked out to Sarr on the right but his inaccurate cross is claimed by Barsham. 45+2 mins: Another Qatar booking, for Ahmed after a horribly unsubtle late lunge at Koulibaly. 45 mins: We’ll have seven long minutes of stoppage time 44 mins: Barsham blooters a goalkick out of play on the right, and Mohamed hurts himself in a clash going for it with his teammate Pedro Miguel. Someone needed to shout for that. Qatar’s level has dipped in the last 10 minutes after a better start. Khouckhi miskicked a clearance inside the area, slipped and Dia pounced in an instant, rifling a low drive under the keeper. Senegal are off the mark. It’s been coming. Horrible mistake though 38 mins: Ahmed puts al-Haydos through on the left with a lovely sand-wedge of a pass but the captain can’t beat his man. But Barsham then almost plays himself into trouble when he stumbles with ball at feet just outside the area, and Senegal are in the ascendance again. Barsham does look nervy too. Senegal should probably put him under more pressure. 36 mins: Nice interchange from Sarr and Diedhou plays the latter in just inside the area but he hesitates a fraction and Qatar clear. Senegal need to start making this count. Once again, that Mané-less cutting-edge issue dogs them. 34 mins: Penalty shout for Qatar! Madibo is neatly played in after a give and go on the left side of the area and Sarr bundles him over. He shuns VAR and Senegal are extremely lucky there, even though a home goal would have been absurdly against the run of play. 32 mins: Ahmed needs lengthy treatment after that foul but he’s OK to continue. “Senegal are still probably too good for Qatar,” writes Kári Tulinius, “but it’s remarkable how much more alert and aggressive Qatar is, in comparison to the opening game. If they’d played like this then, it would at least have been a contest. Ecuador may end up gaining the most from a World Cup host buckling under pressure since Germany in 2014.” What are people’s favourite host-chokes? Italy v Argentina 90 was a memorable one. Spain v N Ireland 82? though they still got through. 30 mins: Barsham has a wobblier moment as he races rashly out to a long ball for Sarr but the forward can’t make it count and Qatar clear. Then Dia is booked foro bringing down Ahmed on halfway 28 mins … which comes to nothing. Senegal come again and Barsham comes out for a confidence-boosting punch clear, but Sabaly picks up and sends a fierce volley wide. 27 mins: A neat run down the right from Mohamed but his low ball in is smartly intercepted by Koulibaly. Senegal go straight up the other end and win a corner … 26 mins: Another Qatar shot! Hasan belts one from just left of the area, and again a clear deflection is missed by the officials. Goalkick 24 mins: Ahmed brings down Sabaly, again done for pace, and Qatar need to be careful with that. After which Gueye skims a low shot just past the post. Best chance so far. 20 mins: Afif looks sprightly down the right and marauds down that flank again winning an attacking throw near the corner flag but Senegal are quick to break and Ismail Mohamad receives the first booking of the game for illegally halting said break. 18 mins: Senegal go straight up the other end and Diatta wins a corner on the left. It’s a menacing one and Barsham, the keeper, is outjumped but it’s headed wide by Diedhou. And Barsham took a blow, and needs treatment. But he’s on his feet within a couple of minutes and can continue. 15 mins: Qatar win a free-kick in a decent position, Afif lobs it in, it’s cleared but it eventually comes back to him just outside the area but he can’t get on top of the bounce and blasts over and Qatar still seek their first shot on target of the tournament. Better from the hosts though. 13 mins: The final ball is not quite coming off for Senegal yet with Sabaly overhitting a pass down the right for Gueye. Meanwhile, Cold War Steve has done a thing for us: 12 mins: Mendy wins the ball in midfield and drives forward to lob a pass in the direction of Diatta but he can’t get a decent ball in and Qatar clear. Senegal well on top already here. 10 mins: A half-opening for Qatar as Hamam probes on the inside left, but it gets away from him and runs out for a goalkick. Senegal’s outnumbered fans are making a decent old racket, band in good nick. 9 mins: Diatta, who’s switched from right to left for this game, gets free down the left and wins a throw. It’s worked out right and the cross finds Diedhou in space but he’s a bit slovenly and his shot is blocked and comes out to Dia (I think) who fires wide. 7 mins: Qatar are keeping their shape better than they did in Sunday’s first half from hell and eventually attack through Afif who excites the crowd with a run down the left but he lacks support and Senegal clear. 4 mins: Sabaly initiates another attack with some adept juggling on the inside right and it’s eventually worked out to Sarr who wriggles inside the right of area and his shot is deflected into the side netting. But he doesn’t get the corner he should have. 3 mins: Qatar look to be playing 3-5-2, boldly, but Senegal have the first sustained spell of possession but waste it when Sabaly nods tamely out of play down their right Peep! And Qatar get us under way. The teams are out. The stadium isn’t completely full but it’s still filling up, Qatar’s fans waving their uniform flags Things you may not know: Qatar’s keeper, Meshaal Barsham is the brother of the high jump Olympic champion Mutaz Essa Barshim, Gary Lineker on the Beeb informs us. Before we start … “Now that Wales has lost to Iran can the USMNT defeat England today?” asks Kurt Perleberg. They could yes, if they build on their impressive first half against Wales and England lapse into the form they were in before Monday. I fancy the USA to score at least, and though England should win a draw isn’t a bad shout. A USA win would properly jigger Wales’s chances though. Back to the game in front of us, Qatar might take heart from Iran’s display: if Carlos Queiroz’s side can recover from a catastrophic and politically-charged opener, so might they. Off the field, crusader costumes are the latest items to be reportedly banned, though frankly I’m playing the smallest violin in the world for anyone in that crass and insensitive get-up. Here’s a guide to what’s not allowed. Fancy a bit of Senegal nostalgia? How’s about one of the best games of Japan/South Korea 2002? Your lunchtime reading: Goal! Wales 0-2 Iran. It gets worse for Robert Page’s side but Iran have deserved this – they’ve been excellent. And there’s full-time. Back to this one, and those lineups: the Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb makes way for Meshaal Barsham, unsurprisingly after his jittery display against Ecuador. For Senegal Ismail Jakobs comes into the defence for the injured Cheikhou Kouyaté and Pape Abou Cisse is replaced by Famara Diedhiou. Goal! Wales 0-1 Iran – Iran have won it at the last. Qatar: Barsham, Pedro Miguel, Mohammad, Khoukhi, Abdelkarim Hassan, Ahmed, Al-Haydos, Boudiaf, Madibo, Ali, Afif Senegal: Edouard Mendy, Sabaly, Koulibaly, Jakobs, Diallo, Idrissa Gueye, Nampalys Mendy, Diatta, Diedhiou, Ismaila Sarr, Dia. Or has he? A VAR check does for him and he has to go for clattering Taremi when the forward was clean through. Wales are down to 10 men. And in Group B, a tense old encounter is entering its closing stages. With Wayne Hennessey somehow escaping with only a yellow card just now … Some essential pre-match reading: Hello everyone, and welcome to our second World Cup game of the day. It pits the respective Asian and African champions against each other, each of whom lost their opening matches 0-2. At which point, you might argue, the similarities end. While Senegal looked sprightly and competitive against the Netherlands, particularly early on, and were undone mainly by a lack of cutting edge up front, Qatar turned in a rabbits-trapped-in-headlights non-performance against Ecuador, and were lucky their opponents declared at half-time. All that Aspire academy cash, all those gifted places in other tournaments, including this one as hosts, all that unsavoury geopolitical positioning – and for that? “Emotionally, things were very difficult, and dealing with the World Cup is completely different. I hope that the performance will be as competitive against Senegal,” admitted their manager, Felix Sánchez, yesterday, adding: “We prepared ourselves for the possibility of an early exit, but this does not mean the end of the project. I am confident that Qatar will continue their project to maintain a strong team, compete and qualify for the upcoming tournaments.” Ah yes, Projects. Always with the Projects. Anyway, Qatar almost certainly won’t play as poorly again, and they have shown some pedigree in recent times. Senegal, you fancy, have more though but they sorely missed Sadio Mané against the Dutch. They will also be sweating on the full match-fitness of Cheikhou Kouyaté and Abdou Diallo, important cogs in the team who were forced off in Monday’s match with niggles. In as much as we can generalise, there does seem to be an early pattern of African teams struggling to score despite plenty of quality and attacking intent. Will that pattern shift here? Kick off 1pm GMT.",

            "A former soldier who shot dead a civilian as he walked through a British army checkpoint in Northern Ireland during the Troubles has been convicted of manslaughter. Belfast crown court on Friday found David Jonathan Holden, 53, guilty of gross negligence when he shot Aidan McAnespie on 21 February 1988, making the former Grenadier Guardsman the first army veteran to be convicted of a historical offence in Northern Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Holden admitted firing the shot from a machine-gun but said his finger slipped on the trigger when McAnespie, 23, passed the checkpoint in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone. He was hit in the back by a ricochet and died at the scene. Mr Justice O’Hara, sitting without a jury, ruled that Holden had pointed the gun at the victim and pulled the trigger while assuming the gun was not cocked. “That assumption should not have been made.” The judge told the court Holden had given a “deliberately false account” of what happened. Holden is to be sentenced at another hearing next year. Members of McAnespie’s family hugged and cried after the verdict. Holden remained impassive. The ruling angered veterans groups and comes as the UK government pushes ahead with controversial legislation that proposes an effective amnesty for those accused of killing or maiming people during the Troubles. Critics say it is an attempt to shield former soldiers from justice. McAnespie had been on his way to a Gaelic football match across the Irish border when he was killed. The army considered him a “person of interest” – a potential IRA member – but he was unarmed. A manslaughter charge against Holden was dropped in 1990, prompting a long campaign by McAnespie’s family for a prosecution that culminated in Friday’s verdict, 34 years after the shooting. The judge said Holden, who is from England and was 18 at the time, was criminally culpable for assuming his gun was not cocked. “This was the ultimate ‘take no chances’ situation because the risk of disaster was so great. The defendant should have appreciated at the moment he pulled the trigger that if the gun was cocked deadly consequences might follow.” The peril was apparent without hindsight, said the judge. “The defendant took an enormous risk for no reason in circumstances where he was under no pressure and in no danger.” After the shooting Holden was fined for negligent discharge of his weapon and medically discharged from the army. In 2009 the British government apologised for the killing and expressed “deep regret” over McAnespie’s death.

As Martin says, that is one of the revelations in <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/sebastian-payne/the-fall-of-boris-johnson/9781035016556">The Fall of Boris Johnson,</a> a new book about the events leading up to Johnson’s resignation by the Financial Times journalist, <strong>Sebastian Payne</strong>. It’s out this week and, although the reasons for Johnson’s resignation are well understood, Payne turns it into a gripping story, with copious, insider detail that has not been reported before. I enjoyed it a lot. Here are 10 things I learnt from it.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) The establishment drew up a plan to stop Boris Johnson calling a snap election as a means of seeing off a leadership challenge.</strong> Payne says that as Johnson was clinging on to power, in the period shortly before he announced his resignation, his inner circle did consider the snap election option. But Payne says officials at Buckingham Palace and in Downing Street had a plan to protect the Queen from being put in the position where she would have to decide whether or not to grant Johnson’s request for an election that was wholly unnecessary and entirely about his personal survival. A “magic circle” of Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Edward Young, the Queen’s private secretary, agreed they would stop Johnson being allowed to request a dissolution, Payne says:</p> \n  <blockquote class="quoted"> \n   <p>As Johnson’s grip on power became more precarious, one senior Whitehall insider said of the moment: “If there was an effort to call an election, Tory MPs would have expected Brady to communicate to the palace that we would be holding a vote of confidence in the very near future and that it might make sense for Her Majesty to be unavailable for a day.” Another senior official confirmed it would be politely communicated to Downing Street that Her Majesty “couldn’t come to the phone” had Johnson requested a call with the intention of dissolving parliament.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) Johnson’s inner circle also considered taking the 1922 Committee to court to stop it changing the rules to allow a second leadership challenge within 12 months, Payne reports.</strong> But this idea was ruled out on the basis of legal opinion saying the Conservative party is not responsible for how the 1922 Committee operates.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Johnson managed to win round some of the cabinet ministers who went to see him in Downing Street on the night of Wednesday 6 July to urge him to quit.</strong> Johnson did announce his resignation the following day, and so it has been assumed that the interventions from Nadhim Zahawi, Michelle Donelan, Kit Malthouse and Brandon Lewis helped to push him out. But Payne says Johnson managed to turn them round. Zahawi began by telling Johnson he should go, but ended their meeting discussing a future joint speech on the economy. Donelan went in saying she would resign, but was persuaded not to. (She did resign the following morning.) Malthouse was also temporarily won round, Payne reports. And Lewis arrived as a critic, but left thinking that he was going to be promoted to be chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (replacing Zahawi, how was made chancellor on the Tuesday).</p> \n  <p><strong>4) But Johnson finally realised it would be impossible to stay around 10.30pm that night, after Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, refused a promotion to replace Michael Gove as levelling up secretary.</strong> “At this moment, Johnson finally reasied it was over,” Payne reports.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) Johnson told his inner circle that he had to quit becaue it would be unfair on Britain to give it a “D-list government”.</strong> Payne reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class="quoted"> \n   <p>When [Simon] Clarke refused to take levelling up secretary, other names were mooted in the study, including one close Johnson ally who had served him loyally as a minister several times. After hearing the name of the minister being seriously suggested, Johnson told the room, ‘It’s not fair on the nation to give them a D-list government.’</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sadly, Payne has not been able to establish whether or this was Johnson’s way of conceding that his previous administrations were just C-list.</p> \n  <p><strong>6) Johnson’s inner circle also took advice on how many ministers they actually needed to run a functioning government at around this point, Payne reports.</strong> He quotes a senior official saying: ‘We could have probably fudged it, it’s not like some hard and fast thing. If you have an attorney general, you’re okay, basically.’ Apparently in 1834 the Duke of Wellington ran the government more or less single-handedly for a month.</p> \n  <p><strong>7) No 10 officials knew their Partygate conduct was questionable from the very start, even though they were insisting that Covid rules were followed.</strong> Payne says that when the Daily Mirror approached No 10 last year before running its first Partygate story, Dan Rosenfield, the then chief of staff, asked senior people in the press office what had actually happened. Payne goes on:</p> \n  <blockquote class="quoted"> \n   <p>The sentiment of their discussion was that some things had gone on and that ‘with hindsight, it’s not something we should have done’ but no one argued restrictions were not observed. The aides then went to see Johnson, who needed no second invitation to get into a scrap with the left-leaning paper and take a firm line.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>No 10 responded to the Mirror story by saying: “Covid rules have been followed at all times.” It then stuck to this line, even when it became clear it was untrue. Payne says it was Jack Doyle, the communications director, who told Johnson and Rosenfield that he thought all Covid rules were followed in the press office. But Payne also suggests Johnon was at fault for taking this assurance at face value.</p> \n  <p><strong>8) Johnson agreed the plan to get Tory MPs to shelve the recommendation for Owen Paterson to be suspended from the Commons for breaking the rules on paid lobbying without even reading the standards committee report into what actually happened, Payne reveals.</strong> Doyle and Rosenfield had to insist that he did read the report. But at that point Johnson was committed to the plan to try to save Paterson.</p> \n  <p><strong>9) No 10 thought it came “very close” to losing the support of Chris Whitty in the run up to Christmas 2021, Payne says.</strong> At that point Whitty, the chief medical officer, was pushing for tighter Covid restriction, but Johnson was under pressure from Tory MPs to resist. At the time it was clear from what was said in public that ministers and scientists were not fully in agreement, but Whitty never formally disowned government policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>10) Boris Johnson wasn’t “Big Dog”.</strong> In the months before he resigned, it was reported that his allies were running Operation Big Dog to secure his leadership. Key figures in this unofficial whipping operation were Nigel Adams, the Cabinet Office minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, and Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. At the time it was assumed that “Big Dog” referred to Johnnson, but Payne says it was an ironic nickname for Adams himself (who is on the short side). According to other reports, Adams will<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/16/johnson-plan-peerages-early-byelections-nadine-dorries-nigel-adams"> soon become Lord Big Dog.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id="block-6380b5418f08a40520c81694" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/richardadams"> \n <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2022-11-25T12:43:53.049Z">12.43pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class="block-title">Downing Street plays down report claiming foreign students could be banned from non-elite universities</h2> \n <div class="block-elements"> \n  <p>Downing Street has played down reports that the government could ban foreign students from attending non-elite universities.</p> \n  <p>Asked about the story in today’s Times (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/25/steve-barclay-nurses-strike-keir-starmer-nicola-sturgeon-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-6380a7568f08edd1a1521ad2#block-6380a7568f08edd1a1521ad2">11.35am)</a>, Downing Street insisted that the government backed the university sector.

They sustain jobs in towns and cities up and down the country. They also bring enormous benefits to university campuses. The financial contribution they make has been essential, given the long term decline in funding for teaching UK undergraduate students, and balancing the books on research.</p> \n   <p>Limiting international students would be an act of economic self-harm that would damage many parts of the country the government aims to make more prosperous.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2022-11-25T13:49:31.657Z">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id="block-6380b3c68f084a383e123fad" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> \n <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2022-11-25T12:28:03.274Z">12.28pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class="block-title">Inquiry into Raab bullying allegations expanded to include complaint relating to his time as Brexit secretary, No 10 says</h2> \n <div class="block-elements"> \n  <p>Downing Street has confirmed that the inquiry into bullying allegations about Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, is being expanded to cover claims relating to his period as Brexit secretary, my colleague <strong>Pippa Crerar</strong> reports.</p> \n  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar/status/1596116802127687681"> \n   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: No 10 confirms deputy PM Dominic Raab is being investigated over third bullying allegation, this one relating to time as Brexit Secretary. <br><br>Other complaints already submitted are from MoJ and Foreign Office.

The amendment did not receive a lot of attention because the government’s main problem with the bill is coming not from pro-development Tories like Clarke, but from the anti-development Tories backing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/22/rishi-sunak-faces-mps-rebellion-over-housebuilding-targets">the amendment that would abolish mandatory housing targets.</a> Downing Street still has not decided whether to appease these rebels, or face them down.</p> \n  <p>But the Clarke amendment is now looking much more interesting because it has attracted the support of two high-profile backbenchers – <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> and<strong> Liz Truss.</strong></p> \n  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="5f9b683ebabbddd1ecd21ab994f14d50554b03e6"> \n   <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/5f9b683ebabbddd1ecd21ab994f14d50554b03e6/0_0_684_455/500.jpg" alt="Clarke amendment" width="500" height="333" class="gu-image"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class="element-image__caption">Clarke amendment</span> \n    <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: HoC</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>During her short premiership, Truss said she wanted to reverse the ban on new onshore wind developments, and so her decision to back the amendment is not surprising.</p> \n  <p>But Johnson did not lift the ban during his three years in No 10, which makes his decision to sign the amendment more intriguing. Perhaps he is attracted by a campaign that might destabilise Rishi Sunak, whom he blames for helping to end his premiership? Or it might just be that, as someone more committed to net zero than most senior Tory, he is genuinely in favour of more onshore wind – but just never wanted to push this as PM because he knew it would go down badly with the Telegraph-reading wing of the Conservative party (which includes a large chunk of its MPs).</p> \n  <p>Seventeen Tory MPs have signed the amendment.

            "Keir Starmer has also accused the Tories of blocking essential development. He was referring to the revolt by Conservatives who want the government to abolish mandatory house building targets (where the government is on the pro-development side) and the dispute about onshore windfarms (where the government is on the anti-development side). Both rows showed the Tories could not govern in the interests of the country because they were divided, he said. He explained: What we’ve seen, particularly in the last few days, is division and argument in the Conservative party about planning, whether it’s onshore wind farms - which are vital for our energy security, bringing our prices down - or whether it’s homes, which are vital. That quarrelling, those arguments, are not just internal Conservative Party issues, they have an impact. It means we won’t get cheaper, secure energy as quickly as we should. They are killing off the dream of home ownership, because they can’t agree amongst themselves. Their entire party are a divided party and they are not really any longer able to show that they can govern the country. Keir Starmer has also been speaking to broadcasters about the nurses’ strike. Here are the points he has been making. Starmer said the strikes were a “badge of shame” for the government. He said: The nurses have been driven to this by the government. That’s a badge of shame for the government. They’ve never taken strike action before. And for patients this is going to be devastating news. Nurses don’t want to go on strike. He criticised the health secretary, Steve Barclay, for not holding talks with the RCN, accusing the government of giving up on governing. He said: Now it seems the health secretary is not even prepared to get around the table to continue negotiations to avoid the strike. [See 2.13pm.] Frankly, if the government is that tired of governing, then they should get out of the way and allow a different government to come in and deal with the underlying questions, like the lack of staffing - we want to train up 15,000 new staff to come in. The cavalry is coming under a Labour government. We wouldn’t sit on our hands, as this government is doing. He said a Labour government would give nurses a “fair” pay settlement – but did not give details of what it might offer. He said: It is about pay but it is also about staffing because, talk to anybody in the NHS - my wife works in the NHS - and they will tell you that they’re under so much strain when it comes to staffing. That’s why our plan to use money, by getting rid of the non-dom status and using that to train up 15,000 new doctors, is a very important part of the discussion. But as far the pay is concerned, what we would do is get around the table and resolve the issue. You would never have a Labour health secretary saying ‘I’m not going to get around the table and continue discussions’. The proof is there. When Labour were in power we didn’t have strikes of nurses, and actually, we had fair pay for nurses. In his clip for broadcasters, Rishi Sunak said the nurses were asking for a pay rise of 19%. But this morning Steve Barclay, the health secretary, said the nurses were asking for 17.6%. UPDATE: The Royal College of Nursing says it is asking for a pay rise of its members of inflation (on the RPI measure) plus 5%. In September RPI inflation was at 12.6%, and an extra 5 percentage points would take that to 17.6% Rishi Sunak has said that, whilst he has “enormous respect” for nurses, the pay rise they are demanding is “obviously unaffordable”. The government says the Royal College of Nursing is demanding a pay increase that would in effect by worth 19%, costing £10bn. The RCN has said it does not recognise that figure as the cost of what it is proposing. In a clip to broadcasters, Sunak said: I have enormous respect and gratitude to our nurses as everyone does for the incredible job they do. And I know things are difficult right now for everyone because of what’s happening with inflation. And that’s why our plans that we outlined last week will get a grip of inflation and bring it down. That’s really important. And in the meantime, what the unions are asking for, I think, is a 19% pay rise. And I think most people watching will recognise that that’s obviously unaffordable, and that’s why I’m pleased that the health secretary is sitting down, talking to the union, and hopefully we can find a way through this. In fact, in his most recent public comments on this, Steve Barclay, the health secretary, just said that he was willing to meet the RCN – not that a meeting was going ahead. He told broadcasters at lunchtime: My door is open. I’m very keen to continue to engage with the RCN leadership to look at the other issues that are impacting, but it is important we also respect the independent pay review body’s findings and I have agreed to implement those in full. But Barclay did meet Pat Cullen, the RCN general secretary, earlier this month. Dozens of organisations ranging from the National Trust to TheCityUK and medical and engineering bodies have slated the government’s plans to axe up to 4,000 EU laws without due parliamentary process, it has emerged. The Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine warned that removal of EU law in relation to medical radiation used in X-rays and cancer therapy is “possibly very dangerous”. The retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill committee has today published evidence submitted by 92 organisations including letters from Facebook owner Meta and the independent assessor, the regulatory policy committee, which has said the bill is “not fit for purpose”. TheCityUK has criticised the failure to give a 90-day consultation process to business. It said: It is normal good practice, in implementing or revising legislation, to consult stakeholders (indeed this is commonly highlighted as one of the attractions of the UK legal system.) The British Chambers of Commerce voiced similar concerns that there was no consultation on the potential impact on business, with a survey of its members showing 30% were not even aware of REUL. The Welsh Senedd said it would be “intolerable” to sunset legislation made by the devolved government, while the National Trust said it welcomed a review of EU law but the REUL was not a “credible path to achieving positive change”. In his Telegraph story about the Boris Johnson/Liz Truss alliance on onshore windfarms (see 11.03am), Daniel Martin says that Truss and Johnson briefly discussed him being foreign secretary in her government before she became prime minister. As Martin says, that is one of the revelations in The Fall of Boris Johnson, a new book about the events leading up to Johnson’s resignation by the Financial Times journalist, Sebastian Payne. It’s out this week and, although the reasons for Johnson’s resignation are well understood, Payne turns it into a gripping story, with copious, insider detail that has not been reported before. I enjoyed it a lot. Here are 10 things I learnt from it. 1) The establishment drew up a plan to stop Boris Johnson calling a snap election as a means of seeing off a leadership challenge. Payne says that as Johnson was clinging on to power, in the period shortly before he announced his resignation, his inner circle did consider the snap election option. But Payne says officials at Buckingham Palace and in Downing Street had a plan to protect the Queen from being put in the position where she would have to decide whether or not to grant Johnson’s request for an election that was wholly unnecessary and entirely about his personal survival. A “magic circle” of Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Edward Young, the Queen’s private secretary, agreed they would stop Johnson being allowed to request a dissolution, Payne says: As Johnson’s grip on power became more precarious, one senior Whitehall insider said of the moment: “If there was an effort to call an election, Tory MPs would have expected Brady to communicate to the palace that we would be holding a vote of confidence in the very near future and that it might make sense for Her Majesty to be unavailable for a day.” Another senior official confirmed it would be politely communicated to Downing Street that Her Majesty “couldn’t come to the phone” had Johnson requested a call with the intention of dissolving parliament. 2) Johnson’s inner circle also considered taking the 1922 Committee to court to stop it changing the rules to allow a second leadership challenge within 12 months, Payne reports. But this idea was ruled out on the basis of legal opinion saying the Conservative party is not responsible for how the 1922 Committee operates. 3) Johnson managed to win round some of the cabinet ministers who went to see him in Downing Street on the night of Wednesday 6 July to urge him to quit. Johnson did announce his resignation the following day, and so it has been assumed that the interventions from Nadhim Zahawi, Michelle Donelan, Kit Malthouse and Brandon Lewis helped to push him out. But Payne says Johnson managed to turn them round. Zahawi began by telling Johnson he should go, but ended their meeting discussing a future joint speech on the economy. Donelan went in saying she would resign, but was persuaded not to. (She did resign the following morning.) Malthouse was also temporarily won round, Payne reports. And Lewis arrived as a critic, but left thinking that he was going to be promoted to be chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (replacing Zahawi, how was made chancellor on the Tuesday). 4) But Johnson finally realised it would be impossible to stay around 10.30pm that night, after Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, refused a promotion to replace Michael Gove as levelling up secretary. “At this moment, Johnson finally reasied it was over,” Payne reports. 5) Johnson told his inner circle that he had to quit becaue it would be unfair on Britain to give it a “D-list government”. Payne reports: When [Simon] Clarke refused to take levelling up secretary, other names were mooted in the study, including one close Johnson ally who had served him loyally as a minister several times. After hearing the name of the minister being seriously suggested, Johnson told the room, ‘It’s not fair on the nation to give them a D-list government.’ Sadly, Payne has not been able to establish whether or this was Johnson’s way of conceding that his previous administrations were just C-list. 6) Johnson’s inner circle also took advice on how many ministers they actually needed to run a functioning government at around this point, Payne reports. He quotes a senior official saying: ‘We could have probably fudged it, it’s not like some hard and fast thing. If you have an attorney general, you’re okay, basically.’ Apparently in 1834 the Duke of Wellington ran the government more or less single-handedly for a month. 7) No 10 officials knew their Partygate conduct was questionable from the very start, even though they were insisting that Covid rules were followed. Payne says that when the Daily Mirror approached No 10 last year before running its first Partygate story, Dan Rosenfield, the then chief of staff, asked senior people in the press office what had actually happened. Payne goes on: The sentiment of their discussion was that some things had gone on and that ‘with hindsight, it’s not something we should have done’ but no one argued restrictions were not observed. The aides then went to see Johnson, who needed no second invitation to get into a scrap with the left-leaning paper and take a firm line. No 10 responded to the Mirror story by saying: “Covid rules have been followed at all times.” It then stuck to this line, even when it became clear it was untrue. Payne says it was Jack Doyle, the communications director, who told Johnson and Rosenfield that he thought all Covid rules were followed in the press office. But Payne also suggests Johnon was at fault for taking this assurance at face value. 8) Johnson agreed the plan to get Tory MPs to shelve the recommendation for Owen Paterson to be suspended from the Commons for breaking the rules on paid lobbying without even reading the standards committee report into what actually happened, Payne reveals. Doyle and Rosenfield had to insist that he did read the report. But at that point Johnson was committed to the plan to try to save Paterson. 9) No 10 thought it came “very close” to losing the support of Chris Whitty in the run up to Christmas 2021, Payne says. At that point Whitty, the chief medical officer, was pushing for tighter Covid restriction, but Johnson was under pressure from Tory MPs to resist. At the time it was clear from what was said in public that ministers and scientists were not fully in agreement, but Whitty never formally disowned government policy. 10) Boris Johnson wasn’t “Big Dog”. In the months before he resigned, it was reported that his allies were running Operation Big Dog to secure his leadership. Key figures in this unofficial whipping operation were Nigel Adams, the Cabinet Office minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, and Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. At the time it was assumed that “Big Dog” referred to Johnnson, but Payne says it was an ironic nickname for Adams himself (who is on the short side). According to other reports, Adams will soon become Lord Big Dog. Downing Street has played down reports that the government could ban foreign students from attending non-elite universities. Asked about the story in today’s Times (see 11.35am), Downing Street insisted that the government backed the university sector. But it did confirm that ministers are looking at whether too many low-quality degrees are being awarded, and whether the rules on how many dependents foreign students can bring with them should be changed. At the lobby briefing a No 10 spokesperson told journalists: Of course we support our universities. They’re some of the very best in the world. And of course will always act in the best interest of the UK. We’re looking at the issue of student dependants and and the quality of degrees and we’re doing that following the figures released yesterday. The spokesperson said she could not “pre-empt” any policy and she declined to define what constitutes a “low-quality” degree. Earlier, in response to the Times’s story, Vivienne Stern, the chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said banning foreign students from non-elite universities would be “an act of economic self-harm”. She said: Cutting international student numbers would run directly counter to the government’s strategy to rebuild the economy – given the huge financial contribution they make to every part of the country. International students make a net positive contribution of at least £26bn per year to the UK economy and are the source of almost 70% of our education export earnings. They sustain jobs in towns and cities up and down the country. They also bring enormous benefits to university campuses. The financial contribution they make has been essential, given the long term decline in funding for teaching UK undergraduate students, and balancing the books on research. Limiting international students would be an act of economic self-harm that would damage many parts of the country the government aims to make more prosperous. Downing Street has confirmed that the inquiry into bullying allegations about Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, is being expanded to cover claims relating to his period as Brexit secretary, my colleague Pippa Crerar reports. The inquiry was originally set up to consider two complaints, relating to his time as justice secretary and foreign secretary. But at the Downing Street lobby briefing a No 10 spokesperson said: I can confirm that the prime minister has now asked the investigator to add a further formal complaint relating to conduct at the Department for Exiting the European Union and to establish the facts in line with the existing terms of reference. The third formal complaint was received by the Cabinet Office on 23 November, the spokesperson said. She confirmed that Rishi Sunak still has confidence in Raab. According to the Times’s splash by Matt Dathan and Nicola Woodcock, ministers are considering stopping foreign students from attending non-elite universities as one means of curbing immigration. Dathan and Woodcock report: One of the ideas being considered is barring foreign students unless they have a place at an elite university. The universities that take the most foreign students at present include Manchester, Edinburgh, Leeds, Sheffield, University College London, King’s College London and Imperial. A crackdown on low-quality degrees was promised by Nadhim Zahawi when he was education secretary. His measures, recently introduced by the Office for Students, will penalise universities with high drop-out rates and low graduate earnings. Dathan and Woodcock say foreign students will also face new limits on the number of dependents they can bring with them. The SNP has described the proposal as ‘ludicrous’. Stuart McDonald MP, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, said: The Tories trashed the economy with Brexit – and now they are proposing an absurd ban on international students that would deal another hammer blow to Scotland’s economic interests. Independence is the only way to keep Scotland safe from these reckless Tory policies, which are harming our economy and driving away the talent and investment needed to secure growth. If Westminster imposes this ludicrous and entirely counterproductive policy – it will be doing so against Scotland’s wishes and in the face of strong opposition from the Scottish government. On Wednesday Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, tabled an amendment to the levelling up bill that would lift the ban on new onshore windfarms. The amendment did not receive a lot of attention because the government’s main problem with the bill is coming not from pro-development Tories like Clarke, but from the anti-development Tories backing the amendment that would abolish mandatory housing targets. Downing Street still has not decided whether to appease these rebels, or face them down. But the Clarke amendment is now looking much more interesting because it has attracted the support of two high-profile backbenchers – Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. During her short premiership, Truss said she wanted to reverse the ban on new onshore wind developments, and so her decision to back the amendment is not surprising. But Johnson did not lift the ban during his three years in No 10, which makes his decision to sign the amendment more intriguing. Perhaps he is attracted by a campaign that might destabilise Rishi Sunak, whom he blames for helping to end his premiership? Or it might just be that, as someone more committed to net zero than most senior Tory, he is genuinely in favour of more onshore wind – but just never wanted to push this as PM because he knew it would go down badly with the Telegraph-reading wing of the Conservative party (which includes a large chunk of its MPs). Seventeen Tory MPs have signed the amendment. More than 50 Tories have signed the Theresa Villiers amendment to abolish mandatory house building targets, but, as the Daniel Martin points out in his Daily Telegraph splash on this story, the Clarke one is potentially more serious because Labour might vote for the Clarke amendment, whereas it will not vote for the Villiers one. Trust leaders will do “everything in their power to minimise disruption for patients” during the nursing strike, a health leader said. Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, said: Trusts up and down the country have been planning for industrial action. Not all of them will be affected directly but those that are will do everything in their power to minimise disruption for patients. Trust leaders’ priorities are ensuring the safe delivery of care and supporting the wellbeing of staff who continue to work flat out in the face of below-inflation pay awards, severe staff shortages and ever-increasing workloads. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, was on Sky News this morning talking about the nurses’ strike. The fact that it was happening was a sign of “gross negligence” by the government, she said. She told the programme: I have to say that today is a very, very sad day because it really indicates that for the first time in its 100-year history, the Royal College of Nursing is now engaging in industrial action. This is a sign of gross negligence on the part of the Conservative government. I don’t blame nurses for saying a situation where they’re understaffed, overworked and burnt out isn’t acceptable. But this is going to be hugely disruptive for patients. If Labour were in government, we wouldn’t be ignoring the nurses as Conservatives seem to have done for so long now. We would be sitting down with them. We’d also be sorting out those enormous staffing issues as well. And we would do that by strapping that non-dom tax loophole and getting the money into the NHS, so that we’re relieving the pressure. But Dodds refused to say whether a Labour government would give nurses the pay increase they are demanding, saying “it’s not reasonable for a politician to sit and pontificate about 1% up, 1% down”. And when asked if Labour backed nurses going on strike, she replied: Look, no one supports strikes. Strikes indicate that negotiations haven’t taken place, that they haven’t been serious. This is going to be bad for nurses because they’ll be losing a day’s pay, obviously, and it’s going to have that impact on patients. So it’s wrong that nurses have been driven to this stage and it’s wrong that the Conservative Government has not been sitting down with those nurses to avert this. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is in Kyiv, where he has been meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The Foreign Office says he has announced “a further £3m of support to the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine to rebuild vital local infrastructure”. It says: Through this fund the UK is supporting the government of Ukraine, local officials and Ukrainian communities to rebuild vital local infrastructure. This is enabling people to return to normal life by clearing debris from Russian attacks, making areas safe and secure, and rebuilding schools and shelters in towns and villages. This new funding will be targeted to areas recently liberated from Russian control in southern Ukraine, including Kherson oblast. Pat Cullen, the Royal College of Nursing general secretary, told the Today programme this morning “life-preserving services” and emergency care would not be covered by the RCN strikes in December. But she said exact details of what would be exempt were still being worked out. She told the programme: What we will continue to provide is life-preserving services. And those essentially fall into emergency-type care … We will have very, very detailed and worked-through plans that every single nurse that is taking strike action will be expected to adhere to. And in each organisation that is subject to industrial action, we set up within that organisation a local strike committee, which is headed up by a senior member of my team, which will be a registered nurse and also then a number of clinical experts that will guide and direct all decisions that will be made. Asked if nurses would be on cancer wards on strike days, she replied: Services such as oncology will be derogated or exempt from any strike action. We have a number of services that we are working through at the minute that will be derogated on the day of strike, and we will release that list soon to employers. Pressed on scans or cancer checks such as colonoscopies, she said: All of the detail is being worked through. Those services that are not considered life-preserving or emergency services will not be derogated. Those that do fall into those particular descriptions will be derogated. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for health, has stressed that the proposed nurses’ strike will not cover Scotland. Royal Mail workers and university lecturers are again on strike today in long running disputes over pay, pensions, jobs and conditions, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) and University and College Union (UCU) walked out on Thursday for 48 hours, with more action planned in the coming weeks. Picket lines were again mounted outside universities and Royal Mail centres across the country on Black Friday – one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Good morning. Another day, another strike, because overnight the Royal College of Nursing has set the date for two 12-hour nursing strikes in December that will affect most of the UK. My colleagues Andrew Gregory and Jamie Grierson have the details here. Pat Cullen, the RCN general secretary, accused Steve Barclay, the health secretary, of being intransigent. She said: If Barclay wishes to meet with me, get round the table and stop the spin and start to speak, he can avert these strikes. My door is wide open night and day. I will make myself available, as will my team on behalf of our nursing staff. That option isn’t available to me at this time and consequently he has chosen strikes over speaking to me. But in tweets this morning Barclay insisted that he was available for talks. However, he also defended the pay offer already on the table as “fair”. I’ll post more on this shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: MPs debate backbench bill, starting with Liam Fox’s electricity and gas transmission (compensation) bill. 10am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, addresses the Poverty Alliance conference in Glasgow. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Lunchtime: Keir Starmer is doing a visit in Birmingham. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions and, if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com",

Suspicious links in websites, emails and text messaging</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There are a few ways you can check a link that appears in a text or email. The best way to tell is by examining the sender’s information, you can do this by clicking on the contact information of the sender, examining the email address or phone number, and checking that it matches up with the company it claims to be.</p> <p>If you notice any strange email addresses or unidentified contact numbers, there is a chance that it is a potential scam. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2. Unfamiliar Websites</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Many scammers will set up fake websites with fake products listed to retrieve your bank details and information. While shopping online, opt to use an internet browser that uses advanced technology, and look out for the padlock icon within the site’s URL bar at the checkout, as this helps protect your information.</p> <p>You can also use other websites to check the legitimacy of the seller, but ultimately it’s best to stick to familiar websites, especially around this time of year. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. Verification Code and Delivery Service Scams, designed to evade two-step authentication</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These messages usually pretend to be your bank or a company you’ve recently made an order with. These messages will typically ask you to finish your transactions by inputting a verification code. Fake delivery messages, sometimes disguised as the Post Office and other well-known delivery companies, are also common during the Black Friday period, detailing information about a product you have recently purchased, asking you to click a link and pay a delivery fee to retrieve items that haven’t yet been delivered. </p> <p>Our advice would be to be cautious of any text messages you receive beyond the checkout, and to always double-check you’ve received an order confirmation via the email provided at the point of order to ensure your purchase has definitely gone through.</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/may/18/delivery-text-scams-the-nasty-new-wave-sweeping-the-uk">Delivery text scams: the nasty new fraud wave sweeping the UK</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-638080828f084a383e123d30" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2022-11-25T08:48:32.279Z">8.48am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Some economic good news – Germany’s economy grew a little faster than first thought in the last quarter, which may ease fears of a deep recession.</strong></p> <p>German GDP expanded by 0.4% in July-September, up from an earlier estimate of 0.3%.</p> <p>It means Europe’s largest economy managed to keep growing through the first three quarters of 2022, despite ongoing Covid-19 disruption, supply bottlenecks, surging energy prices, inflation, and the war in Ukraine.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/carstenbrzeski/status/1596038343820967936">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">German GDP growth in Q3 was even better than in flash estimate: 0.4% QoQ, from 0.3%.

            "Analysts at Bank of America’s Global Research says they expect 2023 to be the most challenging year for UK house builders since the 2008 global financial crisis BofA downgraded Taylor Wimpey to “underperform” from “buy”, and also lowered their rating on Redrow and Persimmon to “neutral” from “buy” Reuters has more details: Broker notes that the housing market sector “learnt valuable lessons in 2008 and has acted with more restraint in the lead-up to this downturn, leaving it on a strong enough financial footing” to weather the downturn it sees in 2023-2024 estimates At prevailing inflation and interest rate expectations, brokerage takes a largely neutral view on the sector but warns that risks remain firmly to the downside Wall Street has made a mixed start to trading, following Thursday’s Thanksgiving break. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.25%, or almost 90 points to 34,283 points. DIY group Home Depot are leading the risers, up 1.4%, but Apple have dropped almsot 2% following reports that iPhone production at Foxconn’s factory in China’s city of Zhengzhou could fall at least 30%, due to worker protests (see details here). Shopper numbers at UK retailers are sharply below 2019 levels, despite an increase compared to last year. Data provider Springboard reports that retail footfall was 7.3% higher this morning than last Friday, suggesting Black Friday bargains have lured some shoppers out. Shopping centres were almost busier, while high streets only recorded around 4% more visitors that last week. On an annual basis, total footfall by noon was 4.6% higher than last year, but over 22% lower than in 2019 – the last Black Friday before the pandemic. So while electronic transactions may be a third higher than in 2019, according to Nationwide, fewer people are visiting retail outlets. That reflects the impact of the cost of living squeeze, but also the move towards home working – meaning fewer people will be nipping out of the office to shop. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, says shopping centres are the Black Friday winners so far. Shoppers are heading to large city centres rather than smaller high streets, with footfall in Central London +11.1% higher than last week and +7.7% higher in city centres across the UK compared with a drop in footfall from last week of -3.2% in market towns. The footfall data demonstrates that whilst trading conditions are challenging Black Friday is certainly not a disaster. Springboard expect footfall to strengthen this afternoon as those consumers who are working from home go shopping after lunch. The dry and sunny weather will also help drive up activity, as will the UK vs USA World Cup match this evening as shoppers may well head into towns and cities and do some shopping and then watch the match from bars in town centres.” The worker unrest at Foxconn’s plant in China could reportedly weigh on Apple’s November iPhone shipments with full production yet to resume until the end of the month. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, explains: Apple has been battling with China’s draconian zero-tolerance to Covid approach to try to combat its record high infection levels. This has been having a negative impact on China’s exports with many businesses moving their factories to other Asian economies instead. More broadly, it is weighing on China’s growth outlook, which when coupled with its embattled real estate sector and the regulatory threat to its tech sector could suggest China is past its peak. This is likely to have negative reverberations for global GDP as China is a key trading partner to the world. As we covered earlier, the People’s Bank of China cut its reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 0.25 percentage points this morning to try to bolster demand and kickstart growth and offset some of the pressures from covid lockdowns and its property crisis. Apple’s shares are trying lower by nearly 1% ahead of the US market open as stocks prepare to play catch-up after the Thanksgiving holiday. Scholar adds: Although Apple is down 17% year-to-date, it has outperformed some of the other tech giants like Meta and Amazon which are nursing heavier losses of 66% and 45% respectively. Apple is still viewed as one of the more resilient stocks in the tech sector with fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenue topping Wall Street’s expectations in October. However, Apple continues to hold off from providing official guidance given the macroeconomic uncertainty. UK retailers appear to have seen a steady, if muted Black Friday morning. Updated figures from Nationwide show that its members had made 16% more transactions than on a typical Friday by noon – still 7% more than last year. Mark Nalder, Director of Payment Strategy at Nationwide Building Society says: Historically this period has been the peak time for spending as people search for bargains either online on the high street during their lunch break. “For the first time ever we also have a winter World Cup, which will continue to boost spending figures throughout the day – especially when England take on the USA later this evening.” Elsewhere in the world economy, Mexico has continued to grow despite the pressures from higher interest rate and the global slowdown. Mexico’s GDP rose by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2022, with growth led by the primary sector (such as mining and agriculture). The good news for consumers is that retailers have been compelled to offer steep discounts to lure shoppers. That, though, will eat into profit margins at a normally lucrative time of the year. In fact, retailers across Europe fear the overall Christmas trading season could be the worst in at least a decade. US retailers Target Corp, Macy’s and Best Buy have all warned of steeper discounts this November and December than in the previous two years. More here. Black Friday may offer an opportunity to bag a bargain ahead of the festive period, but many shoppers will be expecting retailers to cut prices more than usual. The worsening cost-of-living crisis means shoppers in the UK and continental Europe will be determined to find solid reductions. Research from Boston Consulting Group has found that shoppers in Europe plan to spend almost one-fifth less during this year’s annual discount period, due to the squeeze from inflation. UK consumers are set to cut back by the greatest margin in the region, spending 18% less, while those in France and Germany both plan to reduce their spend by 15% and Spain by 13%. US shoppers expect to spend around 6% more, though. More here. There has been a marked slowdown in the UK housing market since the mini-budget in September, an estate agent group has warned. LSL Property Services told shareholders that market conditions have been more challenging than previously expected, following a strong first-half of the financial year. It said the mortgage and housing markets had being disrupted by political uncertainty and sharply increasing interest rates. Across the market, this has given rise to a reduction in mortgage activity and new house sales, and an increase in fall-throughs of previously agreed sales. Shares in LSL have fallen 11% – dragging on the housebuilding sector too. Over in France, members of the CGT union have been demonstrating at Amazon’s logistics center in Bretigny-sur-Orge, near Paris, as part of the global day of action. They put up a banner reading “En grève pour nos salaires”, which means “On strike for our wages”. Britain’s cost-of-living crisis is hurting those in the most deprived areas hardest, new official data shows. People living in the most deprived areas in England are more likely to be cutting back on food and essentials (58%) compared with those living in the least deprived areas (33%). They’re also much more likely to have fallen behind paying their energy bills, and less likely to have invested in energy efficiency improvements. Although not a surprise, it highlights how poorest households need help to get them though the worst cost of living squeeze in decade. The Office for National Statistics also found that the vast majority of adults in the UK reported seeing the price of their food shop rise over the past month. The volume of UK Black Friday payment transactions by 10am was broadly in line with 2021, initial data from Barclaycard Payments shows (via Reuters). Marc Pettican, head of Barclaycard Payments, said. “Our data shows that Black Friday is off to a steady start this year, despite the challenging economic backdrop. Consumer spending this morning is up around a sixth on a normal Friday, according to date from Nationwide building society. By 9am, Nationwide members had made 1.37 million transactions – 17% higher than a typical Friday. That’s about 7% more than on Black Friday in 2021, despite cost of living pressures. The lure of a Black Friday bargain ahead of Christmas is “clear to see”, says Mark Nalder, Director of Payment Strategy at Nationwide Building Society: “Early indications are that this Black Friday will be the busiest shopping day of the year.” Nationwide tell us that Black Friday transactions are up 35% compared with 2019. One change, though, is that the pandemic has accelerated the move towards card payments rather than cash…. Black Friday could be a lifeline for retailers ahead of a potential rise in insolvencies early next year. Owen Bassett, retail expert and underwriter manager at Atradius, which provides trade credit insurance, says Black Friday is “hugely important for retailers this year”. Consumer demand has been relatively low until this point, and people are having to make tough decisions around where they spend their money in light of the soaring cost of living. Black Friday is an opportunity for retailers to entice them to loosen their purse strings. “Businesses will be hoping to utilise Black Friday promotions as an opportunity to clear through excess stock that they are holding onto and generate cash in order to improve their prospects for the year ahead. After a relatively subdued period for retail insolvencies due to lasting Covid-19 government support, we’re seeing numbers creep up, and if retailers fail to effectively manage their inventory and supply chain, we could be faced with an influx of insolvencies in the sector in the Q1 of 2023.” Just in: China’s central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate, as concerns over rising Covid-19 cases mount. The People’s Bank of China has lowered its Reserve Requirement Ratio rate by a quarter-point, which will allow banks to lend more money to support the economy. Yesterday, China imposed a fresh series of Covid lockdowns after recording a record daily high in coronavirus cases. Work stoppages were planned at 10 Amazon fulfilment centres in Germany, according to the Verdi union, as part of a global day of strike action across the company’s operations. Verdi demands Amazon recognise collective bargaining agreements for the retail and mail order trade sector and called for a further collective agreement on good and healthy work. A spokesperson for Amazon in Germany would not immediately comment on the demands when contacted by Reuters. “This is the first time that Amazon has had an international strike day,” said Monika Di Silvestre, Verdi’s representative for Amazon workers, adding: “This is very important, because a major global corporation like Amazon cannot be confronted locally, regionally or nationally alone. Greenpeace activists have already protested at Amazon’s Munich headquarters: There have been protest against Amazon in New Delhi today, accusing the company of treating workers unfairly. Unions in India have been pushing the tech giant for higher minimum wages, reduced working hours, fixed-term contracts, and better working conditions, Business Standard reports. Parminder Jeet Singh, executive director at IT for Change, said: “Amazon has become a global giant exercising a completely new model of exploitation. It is a prototype and the main sign of a new kind of global corporation, which remotely controls all activities of a sector. It becomes a new paradigm of granular control, which creates exploitative conditions for workers and traders. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is cutting production at its UK factories until the spring, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. It’s a sign of JLR’s continued struggle to source semiconductors amid the global shortage. The carmaker, whose chief executive, Thierry Bolloré, last week announced his resignation, has decided to cut production at factories in Solihull and Halewood between January and the end of March as it tries to prioritise its most profitable models, said industry sources. JLR and other carmakers have been plagued by shortages of semiconductors since early 2021. Many carmakers cut their orders for the computer chips at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, only to find themselves at the back of the queue when demand roared back. Here’s Jasper’s story: Cyber-criminals target Black Friday to trick consumers looking for bargains – so here are three threats to watch out for (from website Hey Discount). 1. Suspicious links in websites, emails and text messaging There are a few ways you can check a link that appears in a text or email. The best way to tell is by examining the sender’s information, you can do this by clicking on the contact information of the sender, examining the email address or phone number, and checking that it matches up with the company it claims to be. If you notice any strange email addresses or unidentified contact numbers, there is a chance that it is a potential scam. 2. Unfamiliar Websites Many scammers will set up fake websites with fake products listed to retrieve your bank details and information. While shopping online, opt to use an internet browser that uses advanced technology, and look out for the padlock icon within the site’s URL bar at the checkout, as this helps protect your information. You can also use other websites to check the legitimacy of the seller, but ultimately it’s best to stick to familiar websites, especially around this time of year. 3. Verification Code and Delivery Service Scams, designed to evade two-step authentication These messages usually pretend to be your bank or a company you’ve recently made an order with. These messages will typically ask you to finish your transactions by inputting a verification code. Fake delivery messages, sometimes disguised as the Post Office and other well-known delivery companies, are also common during the Black Friday period, detailing information about a product you have recently purchased, asking you to click a link and pay a delivery fee to retrieve items that haven’t yet been delivered. Our advice would be to be cautious of any text messages you receive beyond the checkout, and to always double-check you’ve received an order confirmation via the email provided at the point of order to ensure your purchase has definitely gone through. Some economic good news – Germany’s economy grew a little faster than first thought in the last quarter, which may ease fears of a deep recession. German GDP expanded by 0.4% in July-September, up from an earlier estimate of 0.3%. It means Europe’s largest economy managed to keep growing through the first three quarters of 2022, despite ongoing Covid-19 disruption, supply bottlenecks, surging energy prices, inflation, and the war in Ukraine. Shares in UK homebuilders have dropped in early trading in London, amid worries that a recession and rising borrowing costs will hit the housing market. Persimmon (-2.4%) and Taylor Wimpey (-2.4%) are the top FTSE 100 fallers, with Barratt Development down 1.7%. Analysts at Berenberg have cut their share price targets for the housing sector this morning. Also, a Rightmove survey has found that demand for rental homes across the UK has jumped. Some potential first-time buyers are putting their home-buying plans on hold in the hope that mortgage rates will drop in the new year. That’s driving up rental prices – a blow to tenants (which will leave them with less disposable income for Black Friday). Energy regulator Ofgem has been accused of an “abdication of responsibility” after announcing a package of reforms designed to bolster consumer protection and ensure energy suppliers are more resilient to market shocks. Oftem says its new rules will shield households, after taxpayers had to pick up a £9.2bn bill after nearly 30 suppliers went bust. The boss of Centrica, though, has criticised Ofgem for failing to protect consumer deposits, warning: “If and when a large supplier fails, the recklessness of the decision not to address this issue will be clear for all to see.” Here’s the full story: UK businesses may have to offer more aggressive discounts than usual, to encourage shoppers to spend this Black Friday. But that will eat into profit margins, as Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, explains: Businesses will be desperately fighting it out for the slimmed down collective pot of potential consumer spending. However, businesses have also been facing a big increase in costs from energy to wages to materials. This troublesome combination of increased costs and higher discounts will put pressure on margins, making it increasingly tough for retailers to remain profitable. They may also struggle with a hangover of too much inventory if sales fall short of expectations, potentially resulting in even more discounts after Christmas into the new year and even tighter margins. In the UK, workers associated with GMB union have planned protests outside Amazon’s warehouse in Coventry. Protests are also expected outside the company’s Dublin offices to push back against two new planned data centres in the city. The Irish Times has more details: “Amazon workers in Coventry are overworked, underpaid and they’ve had enough, said Amanda Gearing, a senior GMB organiser, adding that hundreds will assemble to demand a wage increase from £10.50 an hour to £15. Any workers who walk out during a shift could lose out on the second half of a £500 bonus that Amazon announced for UK warehouse workers last month. The final payment is contingent on staff taking no unauthorised absence between November 22nd and December 24th. The GMB has said linking payments to attendance could be interpreted as unlawful inducement not to strike. Thousands of Amazon warehouse workers across about 40 countries plan to take part in protests and walkouts to coincide with Black Friday sales today, campaigners say. Employees in the US, UK, India, Japan, Australia, South Africa and across Europe are demanding better wages and working conditions as the cost-of-living crisis deepens, in a campaign dubbed “Make Amazon Pay.” The campaign is being coordinated by an international coalition of trade unions, with the support of environmental and civil society groups. Christy Hoffman, general secretary for UNI Global Union, says: “It’s time for the tech giant to cease their awful, unsafe practices immediately, respect the law and negotiate with the workers who want to make their jobs better.” More here: Amazon Faces Black Friday Protests, Strikes in 40 Countries Black Friday is “the last day of Rome stuff” for major shopping chains, argues City strategist Bill Blain of Shard Capital. He says big retailers are: …desperately marketing otherwise unsalable goods at suspicious mark-downs, and arranging consumer loans so they buy it. Black Friday is an enormous marketing scam! Avoid it and shop local! Black Friday bargains may not be as good as they seem, consumer group Which? warned this week. The Evening Standard has the details: Just one in seven Black Friday deals offer a genuine discount and the vast majority of promotions are cheaper or the same price in the six months before the sales event, a study has found. Which? analysed 214 Black Friday deals last year across seven major retailers – Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys, John Lewis, Richer Sounds and Very – looking at their prices every day in the six months before and after last year’s event on November 26. The watchdog found 183 (86%) were cheaper or the same as their Black Friday price in the six months before the event and 209 (98%) were cheaper or the same price at other times in the year. None was cheaper on Black Friday alone. Which? concluded that although there were some deals to be had on Black Friday, genuine discounts were “often few and far between”. More here: Black Friday warning as most deals are not cheaper – Which? A poor Black Friday would be a bruising blow to retailers, as the UK slides into recession. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Moneyfarm, says: ‘In the minds of many, the words ‘Black Friday’ induce thoughts of excess, with shoppers frantically running through aisles or slamming keyboards to secure as many bargains as possible. However, with inflation running at record levels and the UK already in a technical recession, this year’s shopping love affair may look a little different. According to research from GlobalData, it’s predicted that with inflation taken into account Britons will spend less in the two-week Black Friday period than in previous years. If such forecasts prove to be correct, it will add further pressure on retailers, many of whom are already feeling the burden of an extended period of market volatility, supply chain disruptions and a hangover from the pandemic. People are prioritising buying essential domestic products this year, and trying to cut their energy bills, reports Ed Connolly, chief commercial officer at Currys. He told Radio 4’s Today Programme that there is higher demand for items such as microwave ovens, and also energy-efficient products such as heat pump tumble dryers. Connolly added: This is definitely the year of the air fryers. We’re selling two and a half thousand a day, as soon as we can get the stock in people are buying it, because it’s a very energy-efficient way of cooking. Over half of Britons expect to cut back on spending this Black Friday compared to last year, research company Attest reports. It found that most people expect to buy something, but are unsure how much they’ll spend. Nearly two-thirds plan to only shop online – a potential blow to high street retailers who have put effort into store displays: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The stakes are high for retailers today, as they try to tempt shoppers to spend with a flurry of Black Friday offers. But they could face a “Bleak Friday” this year, economists say, as the cost of living crisis means consumers will resist discounts on new electronics kit, homeware, clothing and the like. Plus, ongoing strikes at Royal Mail could deter people from shopping online. Black Friday, originally an American post-Thanksgiving wheeze, is now more of an global event – thanks to international retailers looking to kick-start the festive rush. These days, ‘Black Friday’ deals often last at least a week – running into the pre-Christmas offers, and then the January sales. But some of the offers may not be as generous as they look (and may get more generous once retailers get desperate to shift stock). The CEBR thinktank reckons we could see a “Bleak Friday”, with discounts unlikely to save struggling retailers as UK consumers cut back spending by an estimated £1.5bn in the last quarter of this year. The CEBR say: The cost-of-living crisis, combined with warnings that discounts are often more generous at other times of year and the threat of a Royal Mail strike, will mean that it is a weak year for Black Friday sales and we may see January sales start early in an attempt to shift stock. Black Friday can also suck in spending that would have happened anyway, either before or after the big day/week. This year, people simply have less disposable income to spend at all, with surveys showing many households are cutting back on spending. The CEBR says: While 42% of Brits have reported shopping around more due to the rising cost of living, suggesting they are looking for discounts, a higher share, 65%, reported they are spending less on non-essentials due to these cost pressures. It’s the first Black Friday without Covid restrictions since 2019, which ought to help retailers get customers into shops. But sales and profits could still be lower than 2021. As Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, put it: “Friday should be one of the busiest days for UK retailers but concerns about constrained budgets and the added issue of a strike by Royal Mail workers are both expected to make the affair a rather damp squib. Retail expert Richard Lim told the BBC he was expecting Black Friday to be a more “muted affair” with sales down on last year. Lim said: “Inevitably, I think what we’re going to see is consumers being much more careful with their spending.” Also coming up today Retail giant Amazon faces a wave of Black Friday protests and strikes, as workers stage walkouts over pay and conditions (more on that shortly). Royal Mail staff will be picketing outside the postal groups offices again today, in an ongoing dispute over pay. Eight more days of action are planned in the run-up to Christmas. The UK’s wave of industrial action has deepened, with nurses announcing they will strike for two days next month. Royal College of Nursing members will stage national strikes – the first in its 106-year history – on 15 and 20 December, with action expected to last for 12 hours on both days. The unprecedented industrial action will seriously disrupt care and is likely to be the first in a series of strikes over the winter and into the spring by NHS staff, including junior doctors and ambulance workers. European financial markets could be subdued, with Wall Street reopening for a half-day after Thursday’s holiday.

The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid</strong> for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again</strong> and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive <strong>Volodymyr Kudrytskyi</strong> said that if things continue, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia <a href="https://forbes.ua/war-in-ukraine/za-devyat-misyatsiv-rosiya-vitratila-na-viynu-82-mlrd-tse-chvert-ii-richnogo-byudzhetu-rozrakhunki-forbes-24112022-9997">has spent $82bn</a> – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine.</strong> Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment,</strong> according to the <strong>UK’s</strong> <strong>Ministry of Defence. </strong>In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The </strong><strong>MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties</strong> while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The UK believes that the <strong>Kremlin</strong> is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Half of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is still without power.</strong> Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, <a href="https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official">spoke out against</a> “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to destroy the country’s power infrastructure.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there will be “no lasting </strong><strong>peace” if Russia wins in Ukraine.</strong> He said Nato will continue its support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine,</strong> an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at</strong> to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy,</strong> has called on Europeans to remain united against <strong>Russia’s</strong> war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, </strong>German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, </strong>the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would<strong> “</strong>hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy, said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land</strong>, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.”</strong> Zelenskiy also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Ten people were killed and 54 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said that his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden</strong> early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Stoltenberg backed their membership in a press conference on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine </strong>as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/25/uk-foreign-secretary-visits-kyiv-reaffirm-support-ukraine">would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv</a></strong> to ensure the country has the practical help it needed through the winter.

            "Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin, who had hosted an inconsequential meeting of the warring countries’ leaders last month, comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. During a “family” photograph of leaders of countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) in Yerevan on Wednesday, Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, stepped away from Putin, who had been standing to his left. Pashinyan then refused to sign a summit declaration, as he railed against the recent failures of the CSTO, which ties Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan into a mutual defence agreement. Read the full story here: As attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continues, here’s our world affairs editor Julian Borger’s dispatch from Kyiv. Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. Read more: More on the shelling in Kherson (see 12:21pm), where the governor of the region said that patients are being evacuated from the city’s hospitals because of bombardment by Russian forces. It comes on the same day that a hospital in Zaporizhzhia was damaged overnight. There were no injuries but dozens of windows have been broken Now Yaroslav Yanushevych has posted on his Telegram site: “Due to constant Russian shelling, we are evacuating hospital patients from Kherson.” Children at the Kherson regional clinical hospital will be transported to Mykoliav, and 100 patients at a Kherson regional psychiatric centre will now be treated in Odesa. The US space agency Nasa has released satellite images showing the extent of the energy crisis facing Ukraine following a barrage of Russian strikes on the country’s civilian infrastructure. Night-time satellite images taken from space on Wednesday show the majority of Ukraine in darkness, compared with neighbouring countries in Europe. My colleague Andrew Roth has more on President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine earlier today. He notes that one of the mothers in the behind-closed-doors meeting has two sons in active service, including a local police chief who threatened men who were dodging mobilisation that they wouldn’t be allowed to walk the streets if he returned. Germany’s Bundestag is planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide, a move that parliamentarians hope will serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. The resolution, which will be jointly brought to the vote next week by the three governing parties and the conservative opposition leaders, will describe the 1932-1933 Holodomor as part of “a list of inhuman crimes by totalitarian systems that extinguished millions of human lives in Europe in the first half of the 20th century”. “People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were affected by hunger and repression”, the resolution will say. “This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide.” The victims of the Holodomor – Ukrainian for “death by starvation” – are traditionally commemorated in Ukraine on the last Saturday of November. Kyiv regards the historical event as part of a deliberate campaign by Stalin’s regime to collectivise agriculture and root out Ukraine’s fledging nationalist movement. Historians estimate between 4 and 7.5 million people were killed in the human-made disaster. Moscow has rejected Kyiv’s version of history, placing the deaths in the broader context of famines that devastated regions of Central Asia and Russia. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s national energy grid operator, Ukrenergo, has said the battle to restore power to homes is being slowed by “strong winds, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night”. In a statement on Facebook, the company said “more than 70% of the country’s consumption needs” were covered with priority given to critical infrastructure facilities. The statement continued: Reconnection of household consumers is ongoing. Difficult weather conditions are slowing the pace of reconnection: due to strong wind, rain and sub-zero temperatures at night, icing and broken wires in distribution (oblenergo) networks are added to the damage caused by russian missiles. Repair crews are working “around the clock to eliminate damage” following Russian targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure, it added. Vladimir Putin has met with mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, telling them that he had no regrets about launching his “special military operation” and said he shared in their suffering. In a pre-recorded meeting broadcast on state media, the president told the soldiers’ mothers not to believe everything they see on television or read on the internet, claiming there were many “fakes” circulating about the conflict. Sitting with the group of mothers around a table with tea, cakes and bowls of fresh berries, Putin said he and the entire Russian leadership understood and shared the pain of those who had lost their sons fighting in Ukraine. Putin said: I would like you to know that, that I personally, and the whole leadership of the country – we share your pain. He added: We understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son – especially for a mother. We share this pain. He said he had no regrets about launching what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” against Ukraine, casting the war as a watershed moment when Moscow finally stood up to western hegemony. The mothers’ comments to the president were not immediately shown in the recorded television clip. German MPs are set to approve a motion to recognise the Holodomor, the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33, as a genocide, German media is reporting. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the resolution on Wednesday as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter due to Moscow’s invasion. The Holodomor should “join the list of inhumane crimes committed by totalitarian systems, in the course of which millions of human lives were wiped out in Europe, especially in the first half of the 20th century”, reads the draft text of the motion, seen by the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The draft text continues: People across Ukraine, not just in grain-producing regions, were impacted by hunger and repression. This meets the historical-political definition from today’s perspective for genocide. Ukraine has labelled the Stalin-era famine as a genocide, an assertion rejected by the Kremlin, and interpretations of the famine’s causes have caused friction between the two countries. Robin Wagener, of Germany’s Green party, one of the resolution’s initiators, said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, operated in the cruel and criminal tradition of Stalin”. He told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: Once more, the basis for life in Ukraine is meant to be taken away through violence and terror, and the entire country brought to heel. Calling the Holodomor a genocide was intended as a “message of warning” to Moscow, he added. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, welcomed “very much that there is a lot of support in the German parliament” for the motion, a spokesperson told reporters. Just days after families reunited in liberated Kherson, residents of the southern Ukrainian city are being forced to flee due to Russian shelling from across the river. Kristina Berdynskykh, a Ukrainian journalist, says her relatives in Kherson urgently left following “heavy shelling” last night and this morning. Moscow has begun to “take revenge” on Kherson and its people “for not accepting the occupation”, she writes. Here’s more from the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, who spoke about the videos circulating on social media appearing to show Ukrainian soldiers executing Russian prisoners of war. Preliminary analysis of the videos indicate they were “highly likely to be authentic”, Türk said in a statement. He called on both Russia and Ukraine to issue clear instructions to their forces about the treatment of prisoners of war, adding that all allegations of summary executions should be investigated fully. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has travelled to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise the UK’s support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. He presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have killed at least 77 civilians since October and have plunged millions of people into extreme hardship, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, has said. Since early October, Russian forces have launched missiles roughly once a week with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian energy grid, crippling the country’s power and heat supply. In a statement, Türk said: Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes. Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked. Hello everyone.

Germany said on Friday it was discussing with its allies Poland’s demand to send German Patriot air defence units to Ukraine, Reuters reports. “We are talking with our allies about how to handle Poland’s … suggestion,” a German government spokesperson told reporters in Berlin. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Friday that it was up to individual governments as to whether they supplied Ukraine with the Patriot systems (see 9.53am). As the time approaches 1pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a roundup of today’s updates so far. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight. The region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said there has been no injuries, but dozens of windows have been broken. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if things continue, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine. Forbes reports: “This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy.” The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Half of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is still without power. Energy companies are working to get electricity restored, which will give people power for three hours on an alternating basis. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to destroy the country’s power infrastructure. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said there will be “no lasting peace” if Russia wins in Ukraine. He said Nato will continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. Zelenskiy, said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” Zelenskiy also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Ten people were killed and 54 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said that his country’s parliament would ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Stoltenberg backed their membership in a press conference on Friday. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. British foreign minister James Cleverly said the UK would pledge millions of pounds in further support for Kyiv to ensure the country has the practical help it needed through the winter. Cleverly is visiting Ukraine and is set to meet Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba on the trip. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. All nuclear power stations in the government-controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider, Ukrenergo, has said. Its chief executive, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. “Now the energy system is fully integrated, all regions are connected. It is again connected to the energy system of the European Union … All three nuclear power plants located in the unoccupied territory are working … In one to two days, they will reach their normal planned capacity, and we expect that it will be possible to return to scheduled power outages instead of emergency ones,” Kudrytskyi said during a nationwide telethon on Thursday evening, Ukrinform reports. A missile attack on 23 November meant that Ukraine lost power from nuclear, thermal, and hydroelectric generators. Kudrytskyi encouraged Ukrainians to save energy where possible. Further to our updates from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s press conference earlier (see 9.17am), he also told reporters that the decision over whether to send more air defence units to Ukraine was up to member states. Poland has asked Germany to send the US Patriot systems to Ukraine. He said they were “national decisions”, Reuters reports, adding that some agreements meant that consultation with allies was needed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Europeans to remain united against Russia’s war and to severely limit the price for Russian oil, amid discussions about the pricing EU countries will pay per barrel. “There is no split, there is no schism among Europeans and we have to preserve this. This is our mission number one this year,” Zelenskiy said in an address via a live video link to a conference in Lithuania. “Europe is helping itself. It’s not helping Ukraine to stand against Russia, this is helping Europe to stand against Russian aggression”, he added, according to Reuters. European Union governments remained split on Thursday over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for the war, and Zelenskiy called on the EU leaders to settle on the lowest proposal of $30. “The price cuts are very important. We hear about (proposals to set the cap per barrel at) $60 or $70. Such words sound more like a concession (to Russia)“, Zelenskiy said. “But I’m very grateful to our Baltic and Polish colleagues for their proposals, quite reasonable ones, to set this camp at $30 a barrel. It’s a much better idea”, he added. Our correspondent in Ukraine, Isobel Koshiw has visited Kherson, the recently recaptured city in the south of the country, which faced heavy shelling last night. She has tweeted: “Kherson was shelled very heavily last night by Russian troops stationed on the eastern bank. According to Kherson’s head, Yanushevych, 10 people died and 54 were badly injured as a result. “The initial euphoria was (inevitably) going to fade. But the amount of incoming increased every day and there were more people leaving the city. There was a sharp drop in atmosphere. “The city is/was relatively intact. But if Russia wants to turn it into Kharkiv 2, where every 3rd-4th building is damaged, they could. Their frontline is just across the river. “Though in the case of Kherson, there are even lower prospects that shelling the city will result in any kind of victory or advance for Russia.” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking at a press conference this morning, ahead of a foreign ministers’ meeting in Romania next week. Stoltenberg said it would continue its support for Ukraine and increase “non-lethal” aid, Reuters reports. “Nato will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not back down,” he told reporters in Brussels. “Many wars end in negotiations, but what happens at the negotiating table depends on what happens on the battlefield.” He added that there was “no lasting peace” if Russia won, and also said Finland and Sweden should be welcomed as “fully fledged” members of the alliance. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has tweeted this photograph of him meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday morning. The BBC has interviewed Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, Olena Zelenska, where she refers to the long road ahead for Ukrainians amid the Russian invasion. She compared the situation to a foot race, saying: “You know, it is easy to run a marathon when you know how many kilometres there are,” but adding that unlike a marathon, the Ukrainian war effort is indeterminable. “Sometimes it can be very difficult. But there are some new emotions that help us to hold on.” Zelenska also talked of the difficulty she faced because of the separation from her husband. The Russian forces had designated Zelenskiy and his family as targets. “I live separately with my children and my husband lives at work,” she said. “Most of all, we miss simple things – to sit, not looking at the time, as long as we want.” Speaking to the BBC’s chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, for the broadcaster’s 100 Women season, Zelenska said the Ukrainians are determined to fight on. “We all understand that without victory, there will be no peace. It would be a false peace and wouldn’t last long.” The UK’s foreign secretary is visiting Ukraine today. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has this. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, travelled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet the Ukrainian leadership and promise support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia’s brutal efforts to break the country’s resolve. In his first visit to Ukraine since his appointment as foreign secretary, Cleverly presented a package of support including money for the reconstruction of schools, ambulances, the victims of sexual violence, and grain sales to the world’s poorest markets, such as Sudan and Yemen. With Kyiv under regular bombardment, his visit, which follows a trip to the Ukrainian capital by Rishi Sunak on Saturday, was conducted with a high level of security. The new Conservative leadership is eager to reassure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Boris Johnson’s departure from No 10 will not lead to waning levels of British moral, military and financial support. Cleverly said: “As winter sets in, Russia is continuing to try and break Ukrainian resolve through its brutal attacks on civilians, hospitals and energy infrastructure. Russia will fail.” It’s just gone 9.30am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where some of its residents have woken up without electricity. Last night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke out against “energy terror” by Russia, as it repeatedly seeks to take out the country’s power infrastructure. Kyiv’s major, Vitali Klitschko, told citizens that energy companies would try to get electricity back on for customers on a three-hour rotating basis. He said that half of the city is still without power. The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”. The soldiers are likely to have had heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while they were under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia. The UK believes that the Kremlin is likely to be worried about reservists’ families who will risk arrest by protesting about the conditions their relatives face. Forbes Ukraine estimates that Russia has spent $82bn – or a quarter of its annual budget – on its war in Ukraine, which has lasted nine months so far. Forbes reports: This estimate includes the direct costs that are necessary to support military operations. But it does not include stable defence spending, or losses related to the economy. In 2021, all budget revenues of Russia amounted to $340bn. That is, the Russian Federation has already spent a quarter of last year’s revenues on military operations. If in the spring such costs could look quite acceptable, considering that the Russian Federation received about $1bn a day for oil and gas. Now the situation is different. The revenues of the federal budget of the Russian Federation from the export of oil and gas are decreasing – Russia has already lost most of the European gas market after the Nord Stream supply was cut off. Sanctions on Russian oil will begin in December. Oil prices rose in Asia on Friday after a week marked by worries about Chinese demand and haggling over a western price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reports. Brent crude futures rose by 28 cents, or 0.33%, to trade at $85.62 a barrel at 0410 GMT. G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing levels for a Russian price cap of between $65 and $70 a barrel, with the aim of limiting revenue to fund Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets. “The market considers (the price caps) too high which reduces the risk of Moscow retaliating,” ANZ Research analysts said in a note to clients. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow will not supply oil and gas to any countries that join in imposing the price cap, which the Kremlin reiterated on Thursday. Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on 5 December when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on 4 December. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. He wrote: The enemy again attacked the suburbs of Zaporizhzhia. This time the rockets hit near the hospital. Fortunately, people were not injured, the same cannot be said about the building. Dozens of broken windows. The attacks come as Russia’s latest barrage shut down all of Ukraine’s nuclear plants – one of which is located in Zaporizhzhia – for the first time in 40 years. Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Financial Times that this week’s strikes had created a situation not seen for 80 or 90 years: “A country on the European continent where there was totally no light.” By early Thursday evening, officials said a reactor at one nuclear plant, Khmelnytskyi, had been reconnected to the grid. The vast Zaporizhzhia plant in Russian-held territory was reconnected on Thursday, Ukrainian nuclear power company Energoatom said. This is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest as it happens for the next while. Russian strikes have damaged a hospital in Zaporizhzhia overnight, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram. On Thursday night, more than 24 hours after Russian strikes had devastated Kyiv’s infrastructure, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said 60% of homes were still suffering emergency outages. Water services had been fully restored however, said city officials. Here are the other key recent developments: Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expected the three nuclear power plants would be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves.

Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014.",

            "The Labour group in Birmingham is facing further turmoil after the branch’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) officer resigned over a planned review into a racism row that others have labelled a potential “whitewash arranged by white people”. The Guardian understands the councillor Saima Suleman has resigned from her role over concerns about the terms of reference of the review, which do not include any mention of race. She said she was “disappointed and hurt that as the BAME officer, my views were disregarded by the leader”, adding that “some would argue [the review] is a feeble attempt to whitewash the most serious allegations”. Earlier this year Suleman led a survey of BAME councillors in the city, with respondents claiming there was a “toxic culture” in the local party, and leaders were accused of “not taking racism and discrimination seriously”, the Guardian revealed. Last week the leader of the Labour group in Birmingham, Ian Ward, announced he had ordered an independent review into the culture of the party in response to the survey results. He said the review, led by “a panel of independent figures from the labour movement”, would explore the relationship and culture between the leadership and backbenchers, as well as how the group interacts with the press and trade unions. In her resignation, Suleman said she had “expressed deep concerns with the terms of reference drafted, citing that they were not detailed enough” and more work was needed “given the seriousness of the concerns raised”. In an email seen by the Guardian, Unison’s West Midlands regional secretary, Ravi Subramanian, said the review risked being a “whitewash arranged by white people” and said the terms of reference were “ludicrous and very offensive”. “They do not refer to issues of race, and they bring in wholly spurious issues to investigate,” he said, adding that he had spoken to the party’s general secretary about the situation. The “leadership should not be responsible for setting their own homework”, he added, and “at the very least the BAME officer who commissioned the survey should agree to the terms of reference”. Ward said the review would “be fully independent and in that spirit, it is only right and proper that those carrying out the review are free to establish the detailed terms of reference. They will also be given a free hand to carry out the review.” Announcing the review last week, he said: “The recent survey conducted by the Labour group unveiled a number of concerning views about the group’s culture. “On reading the report, I spoke with the general secretary of the Labour party to propose that an independent review takes place.” He added the review and its recommendations would “help us to grow stronger as a group, and continue to deliver for the people of Birmingham who put their trust in us at May’s elections”. A Labour group spokesperson said: “We regret councillor Suleman’s resignation as BAME officer and thank her for her efforts in the role. “We have a large and diverse group and a new BAME officer will be elected to the role in due course. Group officers are in contact with councillor Suleman to discuss the reasons for her resignation and ensure that support is in place.”",

But he accepted that on Friday the Iranians, who scored two added-time goals, were the better side. “We held them off as long as we could but we didn’t finish the business.”</p> <p>He cheered up at the idea of at least one more game – against England on Tuesday. “If we can beat them, that would be one of the best feelings in the world,” he said.</p> <p>Despite the result, people were reluctant to criticise their team. “I still love them,” said Josie Eddy, 26. “Red wall all the way.” She said she would be helping to organise a screening of the England game at Treorchy boys and girls club next week. “Fingers crossed we can still do it.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="ad2fc021215cf21a534ae61b93e95ca58e025c8a"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2fc021215cf21a534ae61b93e95ca58e025c8a/0_345_5172_3103/1000.jpg" alt="Frustration among fans" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Frustration among fans as Wales fell to a late defeat on Friday.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her friend Melanie Green, 49, said she was gutted by the defeat. With a sad smile, she said she planned to try to get over the disappointment by finalising arrangements for Saturday’s Treorchy Christmas parade. “Busy times – that will distract me,” she said.</p> <p>Treorchy (Treorci in Welsh) and the wider Rhondda Cynon Taf area is probably still more associated with rugby in the sporting imagination, but football has become important here too.

Page announced the Welsh squad for Qatar at the Tylorstown miners’ welfare hall. Recalling his early playing days, Page <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/rob-page-ive-got-friends-in-england-that-enjoy-watching-wales-play">told the Guardian</a>: “You’d see the wind and the rain driving down the valley and you’re freezing cold.

The Welsh clothing and gift shop opened early to sell last-minute clothes and flags. “You can’t watch the game without a bucket hat. It’s the law,” said one customer, Jeff Edwards. Even the skeleton in the chiropractor’s wore a bucket hat and a Wales shirt.</p> <p>At <a href="https://www.treorchycomp.org.uk/">Treorchy comprehensive</a>, the receptionist Christine Howells was resplendent in her bucket hat sitting behind a desk surrounded by Welsh flags. She had three screens in front of her to watch the match. “Just in case one or two break down,” she said. The school’s welfare dogs, cocker spaniels Boo and Lottie, wore Welsh bandanas.</p> <p>Students watched the game in the main hall, a sports hall and the gym. The headteacher, Jenny Ford, said she was glad the Welsh government had given schools the option to watch the game. “It’s been a long time coming for Wales to get to the finals so why not?”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="3197566f87573c367e0611de848e9a1be69f85fd"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/3197566f87573c367e0611de848e9a1be69f85fd/0_216_5109_3065/1000.jpg" alt="Pupils at Treorchy comprehensive enjoy the atmosphere" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Pupils at Treorchy comprehensive enjoy the atmosphere.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The school is big on promoting “cynefin”. There is no direct English equivalent, but it is described in the Welsh curriculum as “the place where we feel we belong, where the people and landscape around us are familiar, and the sights and sounds are reassuringly recognisable.” Ford said: “Coming together for the match is part of that feeling.”</p> <p>Teachers have been discussing with students the human rights controversies that have swirled around the tournament in Qatar, including the wearing of the OneLove armband. “We’ve challenged our students to think what should Gareth Bale have done,” said Ford. “There have been some excellent discussions.” Some students decided not to watch the game because of the human rights issues. “That’s their right too,” Ford said.</p> <p>The students joined in a rendition of Yma o Hyd (Still Here), the defiant Welsh-language folk song that has been adopted by the squad and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/wales-world-cup-qatar-emotional-awakening">become a fan favourite</a>, before standing for the national anthem. And though the result went against Wales, students will not forget the day in a hurry.</p> <p>“The atmosphere and passion was amazing,” said 14-year-old Seren. Luca, 15, added: “It was a privilege to be watching the game in our school. It’s a good chance for everyone to bond.” </p> <p>Kian, also 15, said: “Watching the football brings everybody together.”</p>',

            "They consider themselves pretty hardy in the south Wales valleys town of Treorchy, but there were tears in the eyes of grown men and women as their country’s first World Cup finals adventure for 64 years was dealt the heaviest of blows. Graham Jones, 76, struggled to find the words to describe his mood after watching the game against Iran in the Lion pub. “Absolutely deflated … devastated,” was his best attempt. Jones has followed Wales since he was 13 and travelled to Sweden in 1958 to witness the last time they reached the finals. “That was wonderful,” he said. But he accepted that on Friday the Iranians, who scored two added-time goals, were the better side. “We held them off as long as we could but we didn’t finish the business.” He cheered up at the idea of at least one more game – against England on Tuesday. “If we can beat them, that would be one of the best feelings in the world,” he said. Despite the result, people were reluctant to criticise their team. “I still love them,” said Josie Eddy, 26. “Red wall all the way.” She said she would be helping to organise a screening of the England game at Treorchy boys and girls club next week. “Fingers crossed we can still do it.” Her friend Melanie Green, 49, said she was gutted by the defeat. With a sad smile, she said she planned to try to get over the disappointment by finalising arrangements for Saturday’s Treorchy Christmas parade. “Busy times – that will distract me,” she said. Treorchy (Treorci in Welsh) and the wider Rhondda Cynon Taf area is probably still more associated with rugby in the sporting imagination, but football has become important here too. In the village of Pentre, just down the road, a blue plaque marks the house where Jimmy Murphy, who led Wales to the World Cup finals in 1958, lived. Four miles away is Tylorstown, the village where the current Wales manager, Rob Page, grew up. Page announced the Welsh squad for Qatar at the Tylorstown miners’ welfare hall. Recalling his early playing days, Page told the Guardian: “You’d see the wind and the rain driving down the valley and you’re freezing cold. You’d be ankle-deep in mud. Great memories. It shapes you.” Treorchy certainly threw itself behind the Wales team on Friday, the high street a blaze of red. The Welsh clothing and gift shop opened early to sell last-minute clothes and flags. “You can’t watch the game without a bucket hat. It’s the law,” said one customer, Jeff Edwards. Even the skeleton in the chiropractor’s wore a bucket hat and a Wales shirt. At Treorchy comprehensive, the receptionist Christine Howells was resplendent in her bucket hat sitting behind a desk surrounded by Welsh flags. She had three screens in front of her to watch the match. “Just in case one or two break down,” she said. The school’s welfare dogs, cocker spaniels Boo and Lottie, wore Welsh bandanas. Students watched the game in the main hall, a sports hall and the gym. The headteacher, Jenny Ford, said she was glad the Welsh government had given schools the option to watch the game. “It’s been a long time coming for Wales to get to the finals so why not?” The school is big on promoting “cynefin”. There is no direct English equivalent, but it is described in the Welsh curriculum as “the place where we feel we belong, where the people and landscape around us are familiar, and the sights and sounds are reassuringly recognisable.” Ford said: “Coming together for the match is part of that feeling.” Teachers have been discussing with students the human rights controversies that have swirled around the tournament in Qatar, including the wearing of the OneLove armband. “We’ve challenged our students to think what should Gareth Bale have done,” said Ford. “There have been some excellent discussions.” Some students decided not to watch the game because of the human rights issues. “That’s their right too,” Ford said. The students joined in a rendition of Yma o Hyd (Still Here), the defiant Welsh-language folk song that has been adopted by the squad and has become a fan favourite, before standing for the national anthem. And though the result went against Wales, students will not forget the day in a hurry. “The atmosphere and passion was amazing,” said 14-year-old Seren. Luca, 15, added: “It was a privilege to be watching the game in our school. It’s a good chance for everyone to bond.” Kian, also 15, said: “Watching the football brings everybody together.”",

I’d like to see a scenario where, instead of someone saying: “I’m sorry I snapped at you. I have cognitive impairment, which will transition to full-blown decline within five years,” they would say: “Sorry I snapped. I went to the doctor and now I have to take these tablets twice a day, and the queue is so long!” My goal is to convert a life-changing event into something where all we have to moan about is waiting at the pharmacy. And I think that is within reach.",
